# Agentic_RAG
AgenticRAG is a lightweight, agent-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation system built with AgentApps and custom tools. It cleanly separates document ingestion from runtime retrieval, performs tool-driven search over precomputed embeddings, and ensures answers are generated strictly from retrieved context without hallucination.
